// 3. If any channel is closed then all operation is not stopped and will continue but there will be an empty slot in the slice returned.
// 4. If the context expires before items are complete then returned channel is closed.
// 5. It will continously collect order data for all channels until any of the above conditions are broken.
// 6. All channel data are collected once for the receiving scope, i.e a channels data will not be received twice into the return slice
//    but all channels will have a single data slot for a partial data collection session.
// 7. Will continue to gather data from provided channels until all are closed or the context has expired.
// 8. If any of the senders is nil then the returned channel will be closed, has this leaves things in an unstable state.
