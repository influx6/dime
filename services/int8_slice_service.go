// Int8SliceCombineInOrder receives a giving stream of content from multiple channels, returning a single channel of a

// data. If the time is passed it will cycle to the next item, till the complete set is retrieved from, unless
// the context timout expires and causes a complete stop of operation. CombineInOrder guarantees that the data
// retrieved will be stored in order of passed in channels. If any of the channels is nil, then the returned
// channel will be closed.
// CombineInOrder makes the following guarantees:
// 1. Items will be received in order and return in order of channels provided.
// 2. Returned channel will never return incomplete data where a channels return value is missing from its index.
// 3. If any channel is closed then all operation is stopped and the returned channel is closed.
// 4. If the context expires before items are complete then returned channel is closed.
// 5. It will continously collect order data for all channels until any of the above conditions are broken.
// 6. All channel data are collected once for the receiving scope, i.e a channels data will not be received twice into the return slice
//    but all channels will have a single data slot for a partial data collection session.
// 7. Will continue to gather data from provided channels until all are closed or the context has expired.
// 8. If any of the senders is nil then the returned channel will be closed, has this leaves things in an unstable state.
